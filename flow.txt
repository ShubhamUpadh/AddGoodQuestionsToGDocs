The flow will be as 
1. Search for the files in the given directory
    1.1 The directory address will be provided by me, so no worries about that
2. If there has been any new files that have been added that contain lowercase('GOOD') in the last 4 letters,
   just copy the contents of the file and upload the code to the doc
3. After doing this send a message on WhatsApp / Mail that this change has been pushed

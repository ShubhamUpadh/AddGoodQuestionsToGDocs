The flow will be as 
1. Search for the files in the given directory
    1.1 The directory address will be provided by me, so no worries about that
2. If there has been any new files that have been added that contain lowercase('GOOD') in the last 4 letters,
   just copy the contents of the file and upload the code to the doc
3. After doing this send a message on WhatsApp / Mail that this change has been pushed

Challenges
1. I want to ensure that we don't write those files again that have been written already <- Create a logic
    1.1 I can check if the current file has been created after the last time the code ran, and then only upload
        the changes
